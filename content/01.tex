Graph-based databases have emerged as a powerful tool for data storage and retrieval. Unlike traditional relational databases, graph-based databases represent data in the form of nodes and edges, making it easier to represent and analyze complex relationships between data entities. 
% This has led to a surge in interest and research in graph-based databases, particularly in the field of data science and analytics. 
In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of Neo4j, a popular graph database. We will explore its features, query language, performance, and scalability. Furthermore, we will examine the CAP theorem and its application to Neo4j, followed by a use case example to illustrate its practical applications. 
% By the end of this paper, we hope to provide a deeper understanding of the potential of Neo4j and graph-based databases, and their implications for data-driven decision-making.
